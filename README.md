# IRIS Data Machine Learning Modeling

## Overview

This project focuses on performing Machine Learning modeling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the **Iris dataset**. The dataset is analyzed in a **Jupyter Notebook**, covering various steps such as:

1. Data loading
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.  Preprocessing
4.  Model training
5.  Evaluation

The implementation is carried out using Python's **scikit-learn** library, which provides inbuilt support for the Iris dataset and facilitates model training.
